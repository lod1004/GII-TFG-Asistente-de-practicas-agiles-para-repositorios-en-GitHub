abstract = {In Computer Science education, the ever-changing nature of professional environments demands that students be actively prepared for future challenges. Project-based learning (PBL) has become increasingly significant, enhancing students' abilities to manage and execute projects effectively, and has attracted considerable attention in academic research. Importantly, there is a growing advocacy from the industry for PBL's incorporation into the academic syllabus.Agile management practices have become essential with the software industry particularly susceptible to rapid environmental and demand changes. Integrating agile methodologies into software design education has encouraged students to embrace complex problem-solving approaches. Educators are increasingly blending agile methodologies with PBL in software development courses to foster a level of flexibility that aligns with the shifting patterns of the workforce.Comprehensive software development education now requires students to immerse themselves in agile philosophies, necessitating introductory training and consistent, structured mentorship. Platforms like GitHub have become instrumental for task organization, while automated tools support unbiased grading practices. This study leverages data from GitHub to evaluate individual contributions, covering task organization and management skills. Such an approach seeks to improve the caliber of Computer Science education and better equip students for the dynamic nature of future work environments.},

abstract = {Two key elements of modern software development are collaboration and teamwork. Current methodologies (e.g., agile) and platforms are based on these key elements. This paper describes our experience in stimulating collaboration and teamwork activities of students in the context of a software engineering course at the third year of an undergraduate program in computer science at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy. The students were asked to develop a software project in teams of 3 to 5 students for the final exam of the course. The students used GitHub as a collaborative software development platform. In addition, they analyzed the quality of the developed software through SonarQube. The students were also asked to perform project management tasks (e.g., the Gantt) using the Microsoft Project tool. At the end of the course, we gathered the student feedback through a questionnaire on their collaboration and teamwork experience (through GitHub and Microsoft Project tools) and on the use of a software analysis assessment tool, i.e., SonarQube. From their feedback, the students were enthusiastic about working in teams for their project development and about learning how to use tools which are exploited not only in the academic world but also in industry.}
